### About me:
I'm a Senior Data Analyst in the political reform program at [New America](https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/oscar-pocasangre/) where I research and write on electoral reform and democracy. I completed my PhD in political science at Columbia University in May 2022. In my dissertation, I studied how long-term criminal violence affects communication patterns of political parties and the electoral appeal of anti-crime policies. I have also done research on vaccine hesitancy in Latin America, vaccine diplomacy, and government transparency.

My work has been published in [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/02/28/argentina-javier-milei-reform-electoral/), World Politics, PLOS One, Nature (Vaccines), and Public Administration and has been cited in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/22/opinion/democrats-republicans-education-racial-resentment.html?unlocked_article_code=SQjaToiLpnf0oSYFilzquZwBDWk03grEESY6MkrmHBLm8JCoI_w2psOvGbfJnA4lhujyeAbIYqL9HhzlDiKkzkCJ55aE04PCznxmn-N2ZDlt969SYwsk4voKAjfI63HmJhSaTls5rq4g0CrGUGfdzQOoGNOuZLEscLebaiByPUTr0xQ92cTdW6GvHlQqhkf4iyWtZw9GPVODcs5Qpt0kmaLMCeXC3XijTlyPUFRWx0ZhfOUxphgAj14PfT7zPPifjU8tOIWHxi_x2kHrB4C3DwJVeHAqEXnhw-mf0LL9FVLXIicesJ3nCBJ5S62CGaeF3ELYmedb3h0sPYFriN8Ma7FR5RVk9FML3Yn6gwZT1HnoCDiul_Wr_Vr1pwo&smid=url-share), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/poor-voters-are-losing-out-in-the-culture-wars/2023/03/01/61dbe51c-b837-11ed-b0df-8ca14de679ad_story.html), and [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/19/argentina-elections-covid-pandemic-sputnik-v-fernandez-russia-vaccine-diplomacy/?tpcc=recirc_latest062921).

Prior to graduate school, I worked at the MIT Poverty Action Lab in Santiago, Chile and have conducted fieldwork in Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia, and Peru.
