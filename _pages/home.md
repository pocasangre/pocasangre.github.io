### About me:
I'm a PhD candidate in political science at Columbia University. In my dissertation, I study how long-term criminal violence affects the campaign behavior of political parties and candidate preferences of voters. I have also done research on vaccine hesitancy in Latin America, vaccine diplomacy, and government transparency.  

Prior to graduate school, I worked at the MIT Poverty Action Lab in Santiago, Chile and have conducted fieldwork in El Salvador, Colombia, and Peru.
