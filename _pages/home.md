### About me:
I'm a PhD candidate in political science at Columbia University. I study accountability and state-society linkages in contexts of criminal violence as well as electoral behavior and politics in Latin America.

Prior to graduate school, I worked at the MIT Poverty Action Lab in Santiago, Chile and have conducted fieldwork in El Salvador, Colombia, and Peru.
