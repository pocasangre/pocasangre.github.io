Strategic Communication Around Crime: Evidence From Mexican Campaign Ads.

Can Anti-Crime Policies Shape Public Opinion? Evidence from a Survey Experiment from Mexico. 
  > **Abstract**: Can anti-crime policies shape public opinion of politician quality? I argue that anti-crime policies can help politicians signal their quality but only insofar as these policies are found to be credible by citizens. I test this argument in an online survey experiment implemented in Mexico that exposes respondents to hypothetical repressive and preventative anti-crime policies proposed by their mayor. Both policies lead to an increase in perceptions of mayoral effectiveness in a different policy domain. However, among citizens who do not find the policies credible — because they think they are ineffective, they think the mayor is incapable at controlling crime, or they blame the government for violence — the anti-crime policies reduce perceptions of politician effectiveness. I also find that actual crime indicators do not moderate these effects, except among respondents who blame the government for insecurity. These findings have important implications for understanding the conditions under which anti-crime policies and rhetoric can be effective at helping politicians garner support.
